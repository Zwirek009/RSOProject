TO INIT THE SWARM:
   On leader node (RSO-Host1):
      1. Run: "docker swarm init --advertise-addr 10.0.0.4:2377 --listen-addr 10.0.0.4:2377"
      2. Run: "docker swarm join-token manager"
      3. Run: "docker swarm join-token worker"

   On every manager node:
      4. Use the command returned in step 2. to add swarm on every manager node

   On every worker node:
      5. Use the command returned in step 3. to add swarm on every manager node

TO START THE SWARM:
   ONLY on leader node (RSO-Host1):
      1. Run: "docker stack deploy -c docker-compose-swarm.yml rso-swarm"
   
TO STOP THE SWARM:
   On leader/manager node:
      1. Run: "docker stack rm rso-stack

REMEMBER:
   - calling service endpoint on any node in the swarm redirects to an active service on one of the nodes  
   - "docker service ls" to see list of all services in the swarm (from manager/leader node)
   - "docker service ps <service_name>" to see where instances of the service are and their status (from manager/leader node)
   - Optimal 3-5 manager nodes
   - Every manager node is a worker node at the same time
